# Photo Manipulator
This side project summarizes my favorite frameworks and design patterns.
Some I learned at collage; others were self taught.

So far I've implemented the following languages, frameworks and platforms:
* C#
* TypeScript (JavaScript)
* HTML5
* CSS- partial implementation
* Angular2
* Restful Api- partial implementation

An explaination on how to run the project is located in the file `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
